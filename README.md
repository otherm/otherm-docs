## Project Overview
The oTherm project aims to lower the cost and complexity of conducting monitoring and verification (M&V) 
studies of renewable thermal technologies deployed for the heating and cooling of buildings.   The project 
consists of three main components:  (1) a web-based application that serves as the primary data management 
tool (2) a separate set of Python scripts for accessing and analyzing data, using ground source heat pump 
as an example technology, and (3) a set of Best Practices documents that guide data providers on what capabilities 
are expected for an oTherm monitoring system and M&V practioners on establising a monitoring and verification 
program to meet their specific needs.
 
By standardizing the data collection and documentation of individual M&V projects, there is a greater ability 
to share data between projects that would collectively improve the rate at which clean heating and cooling 
technologies are adopted and deployed.
