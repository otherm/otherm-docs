## Project Overview
The oTherm project aims to lower the cost and complexity of conducting monitoring and verification (M&V) 
studies of renewable thermal technologies deployed for the heating and cooling of buildings.   The project 
consists of three main components:  (1) a web-based application that serves as the primary data management 
tool (2) a separate set of Python scripts for accessing and analyzing data, using ground source heat pump 
as an example technology, and (3) a set of Best Practices documents that guide data providers on what capabilities 
are expected for an oTherm monitoring system and M&V practioners on establising a monitoring and verification 
program to meet their specific needs.
 
By standardizing the data collection and documentation of individual M&V projects, there is a greater ability 
to share data between projects that would collectively improve the rate at which clean heating and cooling 
technologies are adopted and deployed. 

This site serves as the landing page for project documentation, as itemized in the table below.

### About the oTherm Project
The oTherm project was initiated as part of discussions in the Renewable Thermal Alliance (RTA) and initiated with an
RTA Innovation Grant to the University of New Hamsphire (UNH) to begin work on data dictionaries.  Subsequently, UNH 
partnered with the New York State Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and the Yale Center for Business and 
the Environment to secure a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of State Energy Programs(DE-EE0008619 ) to 
build a functional prototype. The UNH Interoperability Lab has been instrumental in the development work throughout
the process.
